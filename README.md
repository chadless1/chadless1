### Hi There

My name is Chad

Currently I am working as an SQA Engineer.
I utilize scripting and automation mainly using python.

Been working in linux and coding for last several years as a hobby as well as make my job easier. 
Trying to expand on networking skills while building a home lab while attempting to learning other programing languages.

Will be adding as many of my python side projects as I can as well as hoping
to colaborate on some open source projects as well.
